        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>My Backstory</h2>

          <p>
            Originally from Florence, Alabama, I moved to Tennessee as a young adult and attended school at the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/gradschool/" target="_blank">University of Memphis</a>. I earned both the B.A. and M.A. degrees in English there, each with concentrations in Language and Linguistics. <br>
            <br>I began teaching college English in 2008, both on campus and online. I loved computer-mediated instruction so much that I went entirely online in 2011. I have most recently served as a Visiting Professor of English at DeVry University.<br>
            <br>Throughout my years of online teaching, there were many times I thought to myself, "I wish <em>this</em> tool or <em>that</em> app existed to make my grading process more time-efficient, or to help my students learn more productively." Although learning management systems have improved some over the years, there were still ways I hoped programmers and instructional designers would work together to improve the systems and their features.<br>
            <br>Meanwhile, as I continued with my normal teaching roles and their associated tasks, my desire to learn how to build such applications was increasing. Then, one day it hit me: I said to myself, "Why am I waiting on <em>them</em> to build <em>my</em> ideas?!" That's when I began to learn all I could about software programming.<br>
            <br>The result? I LOVED it! I discovered a passion for programming that goes beyond the desire to improve the LMS of schools. I found out that programming allows me more opportunities for creative expression, critical thinking, and problem solving that I welcome in order to have a career that is more rewarding and fulfilling. Further, programming accommodates my "seeker-spirit", as I am a lifelong learner, always excited about which new knowledge or skills each day will bring.<br>
            <br>Thank you for taking a little time to peruse my portfolio site to see the knowledge and skills I've accumulated so far!
